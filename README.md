# BSc thesis: Classification of web users by shallow inspection of packets and Deep Learning techniques
In this thesis we address the problem of classifying Web users through a surface inspection of TCP/IP packets. A dataset consisting of about 6 million packets, including traffic generated by about 150 users, was used. To carry out the analysis, it was decided to use Python as the language and the Pytorch library that implements Deep Learning techniques for classification. Specifically, we started with a network and a dataset and then optimized the results. Through the tests performed, it was possible to achieve an accuracy of 70%
