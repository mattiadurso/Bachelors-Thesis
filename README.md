# BSc thesis: Classification of web users by shallow inspection of packets and Deep Learning techniques
In this thesis the problem of the classification of the web users is faced through a superficial inspection of TCP / IP packets. A dataset was used, consisting of about 6 million packets, including the traffic generated by about 150 users. To perform the analysis it was decided to use Python as a language and the Pytorch library which implements Deep Learning techniques for classification, in particular we started from a network and a dataset to then optimize the results. Through the numerous tests carried out it was possible to achieve an accuracy of 70%.
